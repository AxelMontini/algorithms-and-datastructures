# Introduction

This tiny book serves as a summary of most of the stuff that I've studied during
the course "_Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen_" at ETHZ.

The course is in German but the exam is in English: this often leads to confusion, as everything that gets
taught during the lectures has to be translated in English by the students themselves.

While it might be an easy task for a native german speaker, I can assure you that it gets harder for
students that don't speak the language every day.

The whole lesson would be:

1. Hear the professor teaching about something in German
2. Look up the word / term / ... on the internet and look for a translation in English.
3. Rethink about what has been said in English, so you won't get completely
   destroyed by terms you don't know in the exam.

No cheatsheet is allowed there, thus remembering every definition, every technical term, how every datastructure or
algorithm works is a hard task.

Having a small book that contains all information needed in a readable way is a great way to prepare yourself for
that very tragic day. Repetition is the key, the more the better.

Note that this isn't meant as your only source of information during your studies: I might make mistakes while writing this
and I'm pretty sure that I'm not the best teacher there is. [I'm not Abdul :(](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZCFT11CWBi3MHNlGf019nw)
