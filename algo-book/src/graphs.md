# Graphs

A graph is composed of *vertices* and *edges*.

\\[ G = (V, E),\quad v \in V,\quad e \in E \\]

A graph can be *undirected* or *directed*:

* In an undirected graph, an edge \\( e = (u, v) \\) is a two-way connection between two vertices.
* In a directed graph, the edge \\( e = (u, v) \\) is a one-way connection, from vertex \\(u\\) to \\(v\\).

A graph can be *weighted*. In this case, \\( G = (V, E, w) \\) and \\(w:\ E \rightarrow W\\)
is a function that maps an edge to its cost \\( c \in W \\).

Some useful terminology:

* *Walk*:
* *Trail*:
* *Path*:
